# Research Proposal

### Viviana Palacio. 2025.

I've used this template to submit research proposals and various research/teaching statements. The structure follows a minimal working proposal, minimizing white space and with wrapping figures. 

The general formatting is done in the proposal.cls (class) file. The syntax for class files is slightly different than .tex files but it's easy to catch on. 
The proposala document class is derived from the article class. General definitions of the layout and fields (title, author) are defined there.

The preamble.tex file contains additional packages, and modifies the references section with the natbib package.

Beware of the vertical space modifiers, you'll have to change these according to your document especially around the wrapfigure environment.
