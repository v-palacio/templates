# CV template
### Viviana Palacio. 2025.

I created this TeX template based on Nick's CV. Either upload .tex and .sty files to your own Overleaf project, or use them to compile locally with pdfLaTeX.
Some details:
- References are handled with the flexbib package to generate full citations in line instead of as a separate block at the end of the document. 
- I suggest using JabRef or a reference manager to format all your fields and generate a clean .bib file. 
- A preamble.tex file is included to add additional packages or formatting without cluttering the main.tex file that should have all the content.
- Page style has been dry to A4 paper to fit with UK standards, but can easily be changed to letterpaper (US standard) and the margins can be adjusted with the geometry package.

Font preference up to you!
