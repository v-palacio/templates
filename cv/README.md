This template creates a compact CV (example in Palacio_CV.pdf). 
References are handled with the flexbib package to generate full citations in line instead of as a separate block at the end of the document. 
I suggest using JabRef or a reference manager to format all your fields and generate a clean .bib file. 
A preamble.tex file is included to add additional packages or formatting without cluttering the main.tex file that should have all the content.
Page style has been changed to A4 paper to fit with UK standards, but can easily be changed to letterpaper (US statndar) and the margins can be adjusted with the geometry package.
Font preference up to you!
